# This is my jorney to learning java with Bro Code 2025 tutorial.

# The video is 12 hours long, I decided to watch one hour everyday for 12 days
# I'll be updating this with what I have learnt from every hour

**here's what I have learnt with in the first hour or the first day**
since I already have some java basics, I never expected to learn much from this first hour but suprisingly It went long than how i expected.

I learnt;

1. clear difference between the print and the println
2. the escape character (\n)
3. alt key combinations to produce specail characters not directly on the key board eg Alt + 0178 to produce a squared(Â²)
4. differences btn a heap and a stack. ( Alex Hyett video made it better )
5. the nextInt() then nextLine() error and how to fix it with an inbetween prompt of nextLine();
6. a new order of operations acronym PEMDAS. Initially I only knew BODMAS and I was following directly the acroynms but this helped me understand more as they both don't work on which letter comes first but rather on preceduce.
7.  static key word comes before the data type
8.  java doesn't allow a method inside a method. You can still get a clousure using lamdas
# That's how day one went!
